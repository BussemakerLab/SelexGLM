#' SelexGLM: Utitilies for fitting generalized linear models to SELEX data
#' 
#' The SelexGLM package provides tools for inferring protein-DNA recognition models from high-throughout SELEX data using a generalized linear model (GLM) based on Poisson statistics. It was developed by the Bussemaker Lab in the Department of Biological Sciences at Columbia University.
